  Considering an open source home manager, a piece of software that runs on a dedicated device in a house that controlls IoT smart home devices
based on user preferences. The software can be downloaded onto the device for free, as long as the user has purchased the device.
Most management features will be provided to the user, but we can sell premium features like automatic settings based on day, time, temperature, and more on a subscription basis. We picked Apache 2.0
since we retain the trademarks as the copyright holders, and we can patent the hardware / software. Modification is allowed on the users end,
but we should probably stop them from damaging the business model by enabling premium features to be free.
